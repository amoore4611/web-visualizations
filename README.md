# web-visualizations
Belly button diversity data was used to create a dashboard with the following visualizaitons:
1. bar chart
2. bubble chart
3. demographic info chart
4. drop-down button for Test Subject IDs

Belly button data was loaded using d3.json. Each Test Subject Ids were appended to the drop down menu. For each test subject, data is loaded specifically for the test subject chosen. After loading in the data, plots were created using plotly. Data was inserted into the demographic info chart using d3.select.
